# minecraft-customdisk

create custom music discs for minecraft

- adds functions to give each disc to the player
- adds a function to give all discs to the player
  - you probably shouldn't name any track `"all_discs"`
- takes any format as input in the input folder
- takes name from the input file name
- merges with any resource packs in the input folder
- takes the existing minecraft disks and adds a seeded random hue
  - all custom disks will have a random image,
    but given the same input file the output will be identical
